Socket level programming is used to crawl the webpages from a website hosted on UMASS Amherst eslrv2 lab machine - called Fakebook. 
The crawling is done in a depth-first manner and it stops when all the webpages are crawled once. 
In the process, 5 secret flags hidden within the page content are retrieved and output to the console.
